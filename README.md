# HTML5 Tower Defense

A classic tower defense game, currently it's a very minimal game. It works best on mobile environments or touch enabled emulation environments (e.g. Google Chrome developer mode supports this). A live demo can be found here: [**live demo**](https://rednasn.github.io/HTML5-Tower-Defense/).

## Setup locally

1. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is required for managing project dependencies.

2. **Clone the repository**  
   Clone this project repository to your local machine using Git or download it directly as a ZIP file and extract it.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rednasn/HTML5-Tower-Defense.git
   cd HTML5-Tower-Defense``

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Use `npm` to install the necessary dependencies for the project:  
   `npm install`
4. **Run the development server**  
   This project is build using Angular [Angular](https://angular.dev/). Start the development server using the following command:  
   `ng serve`
5. **Access the local server**  
   Once the server is running, Vite will provide a local development URL. Typically, it will look like this:  
   `http://localhost:4200/`

   Open this URL in your web browser to view the project.

## Work in progress

- Developing more projectiles, weapons, enemies and explosions
- More levels
  - Level designer
- Developing waves of enemies
- Since everything has been migrated from an old (ancient) repo, a lot of refactoring needs to be done as well
- Performance updates
